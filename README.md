<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Linear is a modern issue tracking and project management tool that helps software teams ship better products, faster. It provides a streamlined interface for tracking issues, managing projects, and collaborating with your team.

This Alfred Workflow is designed to make it easy to create new issues directly from Alfred (a productivity application for macOS) and send them to your Linear account. Instead of having to switch to the Linear web app or manually create issues, you can quickly capture and send issues as they come up, right from your desktop.

Here's a more detailed overview of what this workflow enables:

<b> - Link Your Linear Account</b>

The workflow allows you to authenticate and link your Linear account credentials. This connects Alfred to your Linear projects and workspaces.

<b> - Create New Issues Quickly</b>

With a simple keyword or hotkey, you can bring up the workflow and start creating a new issue. The workflow will prompt you for the issue title

<b> - Send Issues Instantly</b>

Once you've entered all the details, the workflow will instantly create the new issue in your linked Linear team. No more context switching or manual entry.

<b> -Increased Productivity</b>

By reducing the friction to create and track issues, this workflow aims to boost your productivity. You can capture issues and ideas as they occur, without losing focus or context on your current task.

The overall goal is to provide a seamless way to integrate Linear's powerful issue tracking capabilities into your existing workflow, leveraging Alfred's speed and accessibility. This can be particularly useful for developers, QA engineers, project managers, or anyone who needs to frequently create and manage issues or tasks within their software development lifecycle.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->


## Usage

This Alfred workflow allows you to quickly create linear issues from your desktop using a simple keyword and text input.

1. Invoke the workflow by typing the keyword `li` followed by a space.
2. Enter the title or description of the issue you want to create.
3. Optionally enter priority after the title using -u, -h, -m, -l for urgent, high, medium, or low (introduced in v1.2.0)
4. Press `Enter` to submit the input.

The workflow will automatically create a new linear issue with the provided title or description.

### Examples

- `li Add support for dark mode` - Creates a new issue titled "Add support for dark mode".
- `li Fix bug in login flow: Users are unable to reset their passwords` - Creates a new issue with the detailed description.

You can also use the `li` keyword without any text to open the linear web app directly. (implemented in v1.1.0)
